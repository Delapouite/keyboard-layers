# Thoughts about keyboard layers

Your keyboard only has a few dozens keys. But you want *infinite* possibilities. Here come the troubles.

First, let summarize some options to improve your situation:

- buy more keyboards
- grow more hands
- forget about keyboards

More realistically, let stare at more common solution: what you really want is to find a way to make each key press produce different results. And do so efficiently.

If like me you work on a laptop, you're pretty much screwed on the hardware side. It's pretty difficult to alter the geometry or program macros. Buying a dedicated hackable keyboard will certainly give you more freedom but this also come with a logistic cost: you have to bring it with you everywhere you go, which is very cumbersome if you travel a lot.
If you leave it at your office while going away, then the difficulty for your brain and your fingers is to constantly switch between layouts. So the good strategy here is to reduce the friction to a minimum.

What happen when you press the key labeled `v`? Try, I'll wait for you.

If you're on a text editor it will insert the letter `v` in the document. Magicâ€¦ as well as obviously expected. Next step: press and hold `shift` (left or right) and then press `v` again. No surprise, `V` should appear on the screen. All right, last exercise and you can rest afterwards. Now press and hold `ctrl` and `v`. Damn: the content of the clipboard just got pasted! Nothing fancy in appearance. This behavior is available in most desktop environments.But it proves the point. The single physical key `v` is able to trigger different outcomes.
